The analysis explores how sectors like Biotechnology and Mobile dominate in terms of total funding, the global concentration of funding in key regions like San Francisco and New York, and the historical evolution of funding. These findings guide recommendations for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers to better navigate the startup ecosystem.

### MethodologyðŸŽ¨

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conduct EDA to understand data structure, characteristics, and relationships.
* Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers for data quality.
* Use visualizations to reveal patterns and insights.
  
> Insights:

* Top sectors: Biotechnology, Mobile, and Software receive the most funding.
* Geographic concentration: Major tech hubs, especially SF Bay Area and NYC, dominate funding.
* Funding rounds: Higher amounts are secured in early funding rounds, but fewer companies progress to later stages.
    
> Recommendation:

* Entrepreneurs: Focus on high-potential sectors and consider relocation to key tech hubs.

* Investors: Diversify portfolios and explore emerging markets beyond traditional tech hubs.
